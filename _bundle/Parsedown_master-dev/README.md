# Parsedown dev (a.k.a. Parsedown 1.8.0)

This directory contains the "Parsedown.php" from the `master` branch.

We are using this version as a experimental measure to keep track of the latest changes in the `master` branch for compatibility.

> [!NOTE]
> **Currently, Parsedown 2.0.x branch is not supported nor tested** against `ParsedownToC`. We will, if the Parsedown 2.0 branch is beta released.
