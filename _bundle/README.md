# Bundle Files for Testing

This directory includes the versions of Parsedown and ParsedownExtra that have been thoroughly tested via our integration tests in the `examples` directory.

> [!NOTE]
> **These files will not be included in the Composer archive**. They are only here for testing purposes and reduce the request quota during the tests, especially when running on CI/CD such as GitHub Actions.
