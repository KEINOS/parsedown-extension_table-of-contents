# ParsedownExtra 0.8.1 (Stable Release)

## ParsedownExtra Vanilla

This directory contains the [latest stable release of ParsedownExtra.php](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown-extra/releases/latest). We use this script as a base for our integration tests and compatibility checks (except for PHP 8.2 and above, including 8.4).

> [!NOTE]
> For PHP 8.2 and above users: There is a patched version of ParsedownExtra.php in the [`_bundle/ParsedownExtra_0.8.1-patched/` directory](../ParsedownExtra_0.8.1-patched/).
>
> Which has been barely modified to work with PHP 8.2 and above including PHP 8.4 with no deprecation warnings. The modifications are very minimal with no refactoring or extra features.
