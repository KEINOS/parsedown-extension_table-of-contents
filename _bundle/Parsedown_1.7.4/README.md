# Parsedown 1.7.4 (Stable Release)

## Parsedown Vanilla

This directory contains the [latest stable release of Parsedown.php](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown/releases/latest). We use this script as a base for our integration tests and compatibility checks (except for PHP 8.4).

> [!NOTE]
> For PHP 8.3 users: There is a patched version of Parsedown.php in the [`_bundle/Parsedown_1.7.4-patched/` directory](../Parsedown_1.7.4-patched/).
>
> Which has been barely modified to work with PHP 8.4 with no deprecation warnings. The modifications are very minimal with no refactoring or extra features.
